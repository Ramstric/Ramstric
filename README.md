I'm an undergrad student at ESIME Unidad Zacatenco, in the last year of Communications and Electronics Engineering specializing in Software.

I've shaped myself through multiple personal and academic projects with technical experience in multiple programming languages, 3D modeling software, video recording and editing, digital audio recording and processing on a digital audio workspace, and a passion for calculus and electronics.

I'm currently working on the setup and management of a LoRa server for communication and an article on a PDE solution method to analyze the behavior of human cells in response to external agents.

I have high expectations for the future of Mexico and the many ways I can help to improve through my multiple aptitudes, let's connect and open up to new opportunities!
